# ü©∫üéß Fix all your podcast, video or live stream audio! üéßü©∫

## üëã Intro

AudiomAIster is a fork of [VoiceFixer](https://github.com/haoheliu/voicefixer) with the following differences:

 - Focus on general purpose audio (where VoiceFixer focusses on voice alone, AudiomAIster will reduce noise while enhancing voice and sound effects, making it more suitable for talks and videos where more than just voices exist).
 - Pre-processing the slow parts of the original dataset to improve performance during training.
 - Training and inference from a single package.
 - Upgraded model to Lightning AI 2.0 v.s Pytorch Lightning 1.8.
 - Open sourced model and dataset on HuggingFace for easier inference.

Thanks to an improved augmentation and training loop, as well as a new dataset, I observed better performance than the original on my own videos with 100 epochs v.s 5000 and only 8% of the original dataset.

## Requirements

 - ~~Basic knowledge of a (Linux) terminal~~
 - Working git, python3 and pytorch installation (other dependencies automatically are installed)

## Inference

- Install the cli tool: `pip install git+https://github.com/peterwilli/audio-maister.git`
- To restore an audio file called "input.wav" and save it to "fixed.wav", run `audiomaister --input_file input.wav --output_file fixed.wav`
- That's it! You're ready to go. For GPU acceleration, you can append `--accelerator=cuda` to the `audiomaister` command.

<summary>üôã Why make this model?</summary>

I was doing a live stream in where I unboxed a new 3D printer. I was very happy with it, and wanted to edit it into a video to later upload on YouTube.

To my shock, when looking back the raw footage, the audio was ruined beyond repair. It was my first time using Twitch on Android so I guess that's where it went wrong.

Desperately looking for a way to fix my audio, I encountered the closest free model available: VoiceFixer. While it did manage to fix my voice in some areas, it completely erased effects like me opening a box, which set part of the vibe of the video. This likely is the noise canceling.

I decided this is the way to go, and started making small changes, with each change getting better results. Eventually, I decided to fork and train my own model.

Either way, I did fix the audio in the end. For those curious, [the video is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HmXQuj-WY).
